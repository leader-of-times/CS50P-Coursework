# CS50P Coursework

## Description
This repository contains my submissions for the CS50P (Introduction to Computer Science with Python) coursework. The repository is organized week-by-week, with each week containing problem sets and, starting from week 5, additional testing concepts. Week 9 is dedicated to the final project.

## Project Structure
- `week_0/`: Contains Problem Sets for Week 0.
- `week_1/`: Contains Problem Sets for Week 1.
- `week_2/`: Contains Problem Sets for Week 2.
- `week_3/`: Contains Problem Sets for Week 3.
- `week_4/`: Contains Problem Sets for Week 4.
- `week_5/`: Contains Problem Sets and tests concepts for Week 5.
- `week_6/`: Contains Problem Sets and tests concepts for Week 6.
- `week_7/`: Contains Problem Sets and tests concepts for Week 7.
- `week_8/`: Contains Problem Sets and tests concepts for Week 8.
- `week_9/`: Contains the final project for Week 9.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python libraries needed for the coursework.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
```
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the main script for a specific problem set, navigate to the corresponding week and use:
```bash
python week_X/problem_set_Y/main.py
```
Replace `X` with the week number and `Y` with the problem set number.

## Code Explanation
Each week’s directory contains solutions to the problem sets for that week. From week 5 onwards, additional files demonstrate testing concepts and practices.

## Testing
To run tests (available from week 5 onwards), navigate to the appropriate week directory and use:
```bash
pytest week_X/tests/
```
Replace `X` with the week number.

## Project Week
Week 9 is dedicated to the final project. Details for the project are contained within the `week_9/` directory.
